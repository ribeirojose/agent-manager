# UI feature ownership

The root `internal/ui` package composes the application and the final terminal frame. Help, Review, Focus, and Rail own their interaction policies in child Go packages. Their models have private fields. Root adapters translate concrete store, Git, status, and tmux facts into feature values and execute feature-specific outcomes.

This is an incremental module boundary, not a new plugin protocol or a production execution authority. These in-process values do not introduce a wire schema or change the released-client compatibility policy.

## Keep each feature's contract narrow

| Package | Feature-owned state and policy | Root responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Help](../../internal/ui/help) | Catalog, scope, search, scroll, and body content | Modal navigation, command scheduling, dialog chrome |
| [Review](../../internal/ui/review) | Target, scope, files, request fences, comments, drafts, reviewed marks, navigation, and send policy | Git and filesystem reads, durable review writes, ordered send/rollback effects, highlighted diff painting, editor launch, cross-feature return route |
| [Focus](../../internal/ui/focus) | Key priority, selection, mouse forwarding policy, clipboard generation, scroll coalescing, pane facts, and prepared pane geometry | Watcher lifetime, tmux reads/writes, clipboard and browser operations, status classification, IME publication, mode changes |
| [Rail](../../internal/ui/rail) | Copied inventory, rows, stable selection, filtering, folding, menus, reorder policy, and prepared rail content | Concrete session records, persistence and lifecycle effects, navigation, generic chrome and final frame composition |

Each feature has concrete context and outcome types. There is no shared generic event bus or effect interpreter. A new request belongs beside the feature that needs it. Do not pass the root model or a bag of application services into a child.

The [production dependency checker](../../tools/architecture/check-ui-boundaries) follows transitive Go imports. It permits only each feature's explicit pure dependencies and rejects root UI, store, tmux, config, execution, and application packages. Review consumes [pure diff models and Git values](review-data.md); the concrete Git runner stays in its root adapter.

## Preserve the interaction contracts

Review distinguishes load, file, status, probe, highlight, save, and send results. Its target and generation checks prevent stale replies from replacing current feature state. Closing a review invalidates presentation work while preserving process-lifetime draft and review caches. Durable review writes and send rollback retain their original ordering. A request fence does not revoke a mutation already accepted by a concrete adapter.

Focus receives copied watcher facts for the selected session. Its scroll policy coalesces repeated requests and fetches the latest requested region after an older capture finishes. Clipboard completion is bound to the standing selection generation. Selection, links, forwarded mouse cells, and IME coordinates use the prepared pane frame, including its visible text and clipping.

Rail reconciles copied inventory and keeps selection by session or group identity. Its typed persistence requests are applied through root adapters. Reorder policy applies a typed completion after ordered asynchronous persistence, before admitting another dependent move. This preserves completed-result policy without optimistic rollback state. Rendered rows and their hit geometry are produced together; root composition places that content without a second implementation of row layout.

## Prepare frames before reading them

The root prepares a complete frame at construction and after message dispatch. Preparation lays out child content, records hit geometry, clamps the terminal height, removes private cursor markers, and publishes the final IME anchor. `View()` returns the prepared string. Repeating `View()` does not update feature state, recompute layout, or publish cursor coordinates.

Input is interpreted against the preceding prepared frame. The next update then prepares the replacement frame. Tests that directly construct or mutate root fixtures explicitly prepare them before checking rendered output; they do not require production `View()` to mutate the fixture.

Read-only rendering does not make `Update()` nonblocking. The [ordered effect lane](ui-effects.md) now covers confirmed lifecycle, Rail persistence, geometry and attach preparation with durable partial reconciliation and blocked-adapter tests. Remaining synchronous families and wider acceptance stay on the [roadmap](roadmap-and-evidence.md).

## Verify policy separately from process wiring

Child tests construct feature values without creating a root model or invoking runtime adapters. Root integration tests cover input ordering and concrete caller translation. The [committed terminal smoke](../../tools/e2e/README.md) drives the actual binary through Help, Review, Focus, and Rail with disposable profiles and named sockets.

The smoke does not establish the complete supported-tool, terminal, platform, SSH, or historical-client matrix. Keep those release acceptance requirements explicit. Package placement and a passing dependency graph prove a module boundary; they do not establish exclusive writer authority or compatible rollout.

## Refresh against current upstream

The proposal incorporates upstream `dc471a9` through the migrated owners. Live directory tracking flows from tmux pane observations through the execution snapshot to root projections; Review captures the directory when its request opens. Coordination remains the upstream store setting, with consistent on-request/proactive launch, CLI and MCP behavior. Antigravity retains the final upstream profile, transcript capture, picker and chrome-free activity rules. No legacy root poller or session lifecycle monolith is recreated to carry these changes.
