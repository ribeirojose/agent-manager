// builtinTools is the only source of tool definitions, so a release that
// fixes a CLI's new screen fixes it for everyone on that release.
const builtinTools = `# Rules are matched top-down against the visible pane text (ANSI stripped);
# first match wins, except a matching waiting rule outranks a working match.
# A limit_line match is errored even when a turn-end summary or a limit
# dialog would otherwise settle the turn.
# When no rule matches, the newest turn decides:
# the content region is the text above the last activity_cutoff match
# (the tool's input box). If the region's last content line — skipping
# chrome_line matches (blanks, separators, input-box borders) — is a
# turn_end marker, the turn just ended: finished, or waiting when the
# line above it carries a question mark. A blocked_line there (e.g. an
# interrupt banner) also derives waiting. Otherwise default_status
# applies, and a region that changed since the previous poll counts as
# working (streaming output often renders without any spinner). A turn
# that closes without any turn_end marker still resolves: when a working
# region stops changing and nothing matches, its last content line
# decides finished versus waiting (question mark waits).
